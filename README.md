# sprak.vim
vim syntax highlighting and indenting for the SPRAK language used in the game "_Else Heart.Break()_"
forked from [valeth/sprak.vim](https://github.com/valeth/sprak.vim)

Changed the tab size to 2 to save some space since there is no way to split code on multiple lines (that I know of).
Added the simplest working indent file I could make. Tell me if there is any bugs.

## Installation (NeoVIM + vim-plug)
Add to init.vim (or some other file that is sourced by vim)

```
Plug 'grey-C47/sprak.vim'
```

and call
`:PlugInstall sprak.vim`
